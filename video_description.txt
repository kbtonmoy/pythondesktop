## The Inventory Boss

**Have you ever noticed that you could find an online course, webinar or seminar for just about every subject needed to run an ecommerce business? Yep, with the glaring exception of inventory management or supply chain logistics. Ever wonder why that is?**

**Where or Who do you go to learn how to:**

- Forecast future sales
- Adjust for periods of seasonality
- Prepare for spikes in sales
- Adjust for new competition or market conditions
- Know exactly when to reorder
- Know how much to order
- Know how much to ship to a distribution center from your warehouse

Seems like this should be taught alongside subjects like product selection, how to optimize your listing, keyword research, social media, chat bots, or sponsored ads, etc. Right? But it isnâ€™t. And not having this knowledge can prove frustrating and a bit intimidating for many sellers, especially when their business grows with more products and categories added, and more platforms to sell on, etc.

When I started on my ecommerce journey in 2013, my first platform was Amazon. Trust me when I tell you, it was a way better platform for profit back then. You could even make mistakes, and the profits still rolled in. Not so much today. Today, you need to be sharp and fight for every percentage of profit margin you can get.

As our business took off, I started to struggle with all the inventory issues listed above, as did my other seller friends. It turns out, inventory management is pretty darn important if you want to grow and scale your business.

So, if you too want to master the inventory and logistics management of your business, buckle up and get ready to toss your clunky spreadsheet(s) in the bin. I am going to teach you what you need to know to maximize your profits by balancing your inventory.
